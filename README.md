## 🧭 About Me

I am a backend-focused software engineer with a strong interest in **distributed systems, databases, and reliability engineering**.

- Former **Software Engineer Intern at Splunk**, working on scalability, reliability, and storage-related components in distributed platforms.
- Currently pursuing a **Master’s degree at Northeastern University**.
- Enjoy working close to **storage, consistency, concurrency, and system performance**.

---

## 🎯 Technical Focus

I am particularly interested in problems related to:

- Distributed consensus and replication (**Raft**, leader election, log replication)
- Strong consistency and concurrency control (**Linearizability**, **MVCC**, Snapshot Isolation)
- Storage engines and data layout (**LSM-tree**, compaction, indexing)
- Scalable backend systems and fault tolerance
- Observability and operational reliability in distributed systems

---

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### **Distributed Fault-Tolerant Storage Systems**  
*Golang · Raft · RPC · Linearizability*

- Implemented **Raft consensus** with persistence, snapshotting, and crash recovery.
- Built a **fault-tolerant Key/Value store** providing linearizable APIs.
- Designed a **sharded KV system** with dynamic reconfiguration and online shard migration.
- Implemented client deduplication and at-most-once semantics.
- Built a simple **MapReduce framework** with centralized coordination and fault recovery.

---

### **Distributed SQL Database**  
*Rust · SQL · RocksDB · Redis · MVCC · LSM-tree · gRPC*

- Designed a distributed SQL engine focusing on **query processing** and **transactional consistency**.
- Implemented a cost-based optimizer, parallel execution engine, and predicate pushdown.
- Built a hybrid storage layer with RocksDB and Redis.
- Implemented MVCC with snapshot isolation and Raft-based replication.

---

### **High-Performance Database Engine**  
*C++ · SQL · MVCC*

- Built a single-node database engine focusing on **concurrency control** and **query execution**.
- Implemented buffer pool management, B+ tree indexes, and vectorized execution.
- Designed locking and deadlock detection mechanisms.

---

## 🔍 What I’m Currently Exploring

- Trade-offs between **strong consistency and performance** in real-world distributed systems
- Log-structured storage vs. page-oriented storage
- Observability patterns for storage and data platforms
- Failure modes in replicated state machines

---

## 🧠 Engineering Notes

I value systems that are:

- **Correct before fast**
- Explicit about **failure models**
- Designed with **operability and debuggability** in mind

I enjoy reading papers, implementing ideas from scratch, and validating them through experiments.
