## 🧭 About Me

I am a backend-focused software engineer with a strong interest in **distributed systems, databases, and reliability engineering**.

- Former **Software Engineer Intern at Splunk**, working on scalability, reliability, and storage-related components in distributed platforms.
- Currently pursuing a **Master’s degree at Northeastern University**.
- Enjoy working close to **storage, consistency, concurrency, and system performance**.

---

## 🎯 Technical Focus

I am particularly interested in problems related to:

- Distributed consensus and replication (**Raft**, leader election, log replication)
- Strong consistency and concurrency control (**Linearizability**, **MVCC**, Snapshot Isolation)
- Storage engines and data layout (**LSM-tree**, compaction, indexing)
- Scalable backend systems and fault tolerance
- Observability and operational reliability in distributed systems

---

## 🧠 Engineering Notes

I value systems that are:

- **Correct before fast**
- Explicit about **failure models**
- Designed with **operability and debuggability** in mind

I enjoy reading papers, implementing ideas from scratch, and validating them through experiments.
