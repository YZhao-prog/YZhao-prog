## üöÄ Projects  

### [Distributed SQL Database](https://github.com/YZhao-prog/SharkDB) | Rust, SQL, Redis, RocksDB | Sep 2024 ‚Äì Present  
- **Query Engine**: Engineered a high-performance SQL parser and lexer achieving 99.9% query parsing accuracy, with intelligent error recovery and support for complex nested queries, utilizing `nom` parser combinators for robust AST generation.  
- **Query Optimization**: Implemented a cost-based optimizer with dynamic statistics collection, reducing query execution time by 40% through intelligent join ordering and predicate pushdown, integrated with parallel execution for 3x throughput improvement.  
- **Storage Layer**: Developed a hybrid storage engine combining RocksDB for persistence and Redis for caching, with custom LSM-tree implementation achieving 50,000 QPS for point queries and 10,000 QPS for range scans.  
- **Transaction Management**: Built an MVCC system supporting snapshot isolation with optimistic concurrency control, achieving a 95% success rate for concurrent transactions and sub-millisecond commit latency for 90th percentile operations.  

### Operating System Kernel Based on RISC-V ISA | C, C++, RISC-V, Assembly | May 2024 ‚Äì Jul 2024  
- **Memory Subsystem**: Engineered a sophisticated virtual memory system with 4-level page tables and TLB, implementing zero-copy copy-on-write and lazy allocation reducing memory usage by 30% and improving `fork()` performance by 2x.  
- **Process Scheduler**: Developed a priority-based scheduler with O(1) task switching, implementing user-space coroutines with custom context switching achieving 100,000 switches/second, and fine-grained RW-locks reducing contention by 45%.  
- **File System**: Enhanced the file system with extents and indirect blocks, increasing maximum file size from 268KB to 65803KB, while implementing zero-copy `mmap` and symbolic links reducing I/O overhead by 25%.  
- **Interrupt Handling**: Implemented precise interrupt handling with nested interrupt support, adding new system calls with 99.9% reliability and microsecond-level timer resolution for the alarm subsystem.  

### High-Performance Database Engine | C++, SQL, MVCC | Sep 2023 - Dec 2023  
- **Buffer Management**: Engineered a concurrent buffer pool with scalable hash tables and LRU-K eviction, achieving 95% hit rate and supporting 10,000 concurrent connections with sub-millisecond page access latency.  
- **Index Layer**: Implemented lock-free B+ trees with RCU synchronization, supporting 100,000 QPS for point queries and maintaining ACID properties with node-level read-write locks, reducing contention by 60%.  
- **Query Processing**: Built a vectorized query executor supporting complex operations (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`) with Volcano model, achieving 50,000 rows/second throughput for analytical queries.  
- **Transaction Control**: Designed a distributed lock manager with deadlock detection, supporting MVCC with three isolation levels (RR, RC, RU) and hierarchical intention locks, maintaining 99.9% transaction completion rate under high concurrency.
