## 🧭 About Me

Hi 👋 I’m Yang — a backend-focused engineer who enjoys working close to the **core of distributed systems**.

- Former **Software Engineer Intern at Splunk**, where I worked on **storage pipelines, artifact lifecycle management, and cross-node consistency** in large-scale distributed search clusters.
- Currently pursuing a **Master’s degree at Northeastern University**.
- I enjoy building systems where **correctness matters more than demos**, and where failures are expected, observable, and recoverable.

I’m especially interested in how systems behave **under load, partial failures, and real-world constraints** — not just when everything goes right.

---

## 🎯 Technical Focus

What I like working on (and thinking about):

- **Distributed consensus & replication**  
  Raft, leader election, log replication, crash recovery

- **Consistency & concurrency control**  
  Linearizability, MVCC, Snapshot Isolation, request deduplication

- **Storage systems & data layout**  
  LSM-trees, compaction strategies, caching layers, indexing

- **Production reliability**  
  Fault tolerance, rolling upgrades, observability, debuggability

---

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

Some opinions I tend to stick to:

- ✅ **Correct before fast** (performance comes after invariants)
- 🔍 Make **failure modes explicit**
- 🛠 Design for **operability, not just happy paths**
- 📈 Benchmark before assuming something is “fast enough”

I enjoy reading systems papers, implementing ideas from scratch, and validating designs through experiments and benchmarks — then questioning my own assumptions.

## 📌 What you’ll mostly find here

- Distributed systems experiments (Raft, KV stores, sharding)
- Storage engines and database internals
- Backend infrastructure prototypes
- Notes and code written to **understand trade-offs**, not just pass tests
